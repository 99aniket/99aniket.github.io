CSS Horizontal Navigation Bar
Horizontal Navigation Bar
HomeNewsContact
There are two ways to create a horizontal navigation bar. Using inline or floating list items.

Inline List Items
One way to build a horizontal navigation bar is to specify the <li> elements as inline, in addition to the "standard" code from the previous page:

Example
li {
  display: inline;
}
Example explained:

display: inline; - By default, <li> elements are block elements. Here, we remove the line breaks before and after each list item, to display them on one line
Floating List Items
Another way of creating a horizontal navigation bar is to float the <li> elements, and specify a layout for the navigation links:

Example
li {
  float: left;
}

a {
  display: block;
  padding: 28px;
  background-color: #0000FF;
}
Example explained:

float: left; - Use float to get block elements to float next to each other
display: block; - Allows us to specify padding (and height, width, margins, etc. if you want)
padding: 8px; - Specify some padding between each <a> element, to make them look good
background-color: #dddddd; - Add a gray background-color to each <a> element
Tip: Add the background-color to <ul> instead of each <a> element if you want a full-width background color:

Example
ul {
  background-color: #dddddd;
}
Horizontal Navigation Bar Examples
Create a basic horizontal navigation bar with a dark background color and change the background color of the links when the user moves the mouse over them:

HomeNewsContactAbout
Example
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #333;
}

li {
  float: left;
}

li a {
  display: blue;
  color: green;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* Change the link color to #0000FF (blue) on hover */
li a:blue {
  background-color "#0000FF";
}
</style>
